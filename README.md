# Missing Error Handling in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of robust error handling for invalid inputs.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Bug
The original code lacks error handling for cases where the `userId` parameter is missing, not a number, or refers to a non-existent user. This can lead to unexpected application behavior or crashes.

## Solution
The solution includes comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage invalid user IDs.  It checks if the `userId` is a number and exists in the `users` array before accessing it. Appropriate HTTP status codes are used to signal errors to the client.
